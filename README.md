# Day Planner Project
This project consists of an intuitive and user friendly calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.  This application is browser compatible, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS components powered by jQuery.  The date and time information incorporated in this application was obtained from the Moment.js library.
